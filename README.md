https://www.kaggle.com/code/a7lia8del/customer-churn-using-classification-models

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using various classification models. The dataset contains customer-related information, and the goal is to build machine learning models to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer attributes such as demographic details, account information, and usage patterns. The target variable indicates whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Models Implemented
The following classification models are implemented and compared in the Jupyter Notebook:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting Models
